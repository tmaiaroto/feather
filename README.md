# Feather

What the f--!? Another CSS framework??

Yea, but not really. The last thing I want to do is re-invent the wheel. I don't have time to re-invent the wheel. 
That said, the other frameworks I found were great, but only in part. Many are simply too heavy and too opinionated. 
So many rely on jQuery and if you're going to use jQuery anyway, then that's not so bad...But what if you aren't?

I noticed so many frameworks are good at a few particular things and then they just filled in the rest and added what 
they thought they "needed" in a more rushed manner. The end result is meh.

Feather aims to be lightweight and beautiful. It uses bits and pieces from other projects (see the vendors directory) 
to accomplish this. It isn't overly opinionated and so it doesn't come with quite as many components, but there's still 
enough to be a solid foundation for any project.

Opinions may be formed by way of themes that can be added on top of Feather. Where such opinions belong.

In addition to themes or kits, there's going to be one other thing Feather will keep separate and do: 3rd party add-ons.

Feather will maintain a list of preferred vendors or 3rd party add-ons for X. Meaning if you need a video player, 
there will be a list full of video players that work well with Feather and appreciate the same values; clean design, 
file size, and flexibility.
